The week 2 update:
- The Piano key was stitched with the conductive patch.
- The crosses indicate the placement of the conductive patch. The wooden pieces were set in order to provide a stiff support underneath the keys for better capacitance sensing. 
- The code was further altered to read the conductive patch and recognize different keys. The sensing was calibrated to read the keys. The output was displayed in the serial monitor as the following video.
- The placement of the controller was planned.
